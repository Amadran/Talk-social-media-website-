## A Simple Social Media Website Project

This is just a simple project that is meant to serve as practice for myself for full stack web development. The website is a simple social media website that is meant to resemble Twitter, with the ability to sign-up, login, add, edit, and delete posts, change your user avatar and preferences, etc. (standard social media CRUD operations).

I'm building this site using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack - React.js and CSS for the front-end, Express (in Node.js) for the back-end, which is connected to a MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas, at least for now) using the Mongoose library.
